# react-scripts

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).<br>

To customize, create `config/webpack.custom.{dev|prod}.js` and export a function. The function will be given the react-scripts webpack configuration as the only parameters and
should return a webpack configuration object (modified as you want).
